### Thank you for your interest in the PACE Study at UC Davis!
Once you're registered for the study, you will receive all required information about the study on the mail that you entered in the registration process. If you have any questions about the study, please reach out to the [study team](mailto:psy.dynamics@hu-berlin.de) via email. Thank you!

### Below, you find detailed information on the study: 

In the Personality and Contextualized Experiences (PACE) Study, we seek to examine how individuals differ in the ways their experiences and behaviors change over time and across different situations in everyday life. The study may take up to 30 days in total, and we ask you to only participate if you are available for the entire duration of the study.

Before the study begins, you will register by providing informed consent and your email address. After registration, you will be able to choose a start date for the baseline survey, which can be scheduled on any of the five days following your registration.

Part 1: On the selected day in the registration, you will receive an invitation for the baseline survey. This survey must be completed on a computer on the same day. In the baseline survey, you will respond to a novel battery of questions to assess your typical patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and we will ask you to tailor some of the contextual questions that we will repeatedly ask you in the next part. In addition, we will ask you to provide demographic information and to complete additional batteries of questions that are well-established for the assessment of personality traits.

Part 2: The following day, the part of the study that uses the experience-sampling method (ESM) will start. This means that we will send you multiple invitations per day via SMS and/or email (depending on your indicated preference in the registration) to complete short surveys on your smartphone. An internet connection is required to open the surveys. In the short surveys, we will ask you questions about your current experiences and behaviors as well as about your momentary situation (e.g., where you are, whether you have company etc.). The duration of the ESM part will either be 14 or 28 days, and you will have either 30 minutes or 1 hour to complete the surveys after receiving the invitation, depending on the condition you will be randomly assigned to after completing the baseline questionnaire. In both conditions, we will send you 114 short surveys in total, each of which will not take longer than 4 minutes to complete. To fully utilize your data in our planned analyses, it is essential that you complete at least 100 short surveys. We are aware that completing 100 short surveys is a lot to ask, and fully understand if this may be too much and youâ€™d rather not participate. However, if you decide to participate but miss a lot of surveys, we will remove you from the study to save your and our time and resources.

Part 3: If you completed at least 100 ESM surveys in Part 2, you will be invited to a follow-up assessment the following day in which we will ask you once more to complete the novel battery that you also completed during the baseline survey. Subsequently, we will let you know how we would describe your typical patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors based on the novel battery vs. your responses to the ESM surveys. As these two ways to describe personality often diverge, we will ask you which description you find more accurate and why. Lastly, we will ask you about your experience with the ESM part of the study, and to respond to another set of well-established questionnaires assessing your personality.


The baseline survey in Part 1 will take no more than an hour to complete. Each ESM survey that of Part 2 should take no longer than 4 minutes to complete such that completing 100 surveys should take no longer than 6.6 hours. Lasty, the follow-up survey in Part 3 will take again no more than an hour. Thus, the participation in the study should not exceed 8.6 hours in total.

As compensation, we offer a combination of course credits and individual feedback based on your ESM reports that will be granted as follows:

First, for completing the baseline assessment and at least 25 ESM reports within the first half of the study you will receive 3 course credits.

Second, for completing additional 35 ESM reports (60 in total) you will receive additional 2 course credits.

Third, for completing additional 40 ESM reports (100 in total) and the follow-up, you will have a 1/5 chance to win $75 and will receive feedback based on your provided responses of the ESM reports. For example, we will let you know in which places or with which activities you spend most of your time, when and where you were happiest, and how your stress changes within a day and across a week.
